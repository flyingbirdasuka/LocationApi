This LocationAPI makes several third party api calls in one application by using the Guzzle library in Laravel.

You can get the information about the location.

You enter the location (city) where you'd like to search in the input field and after clicking the check button we get the weather information about that location by calling an endpoint at "api.openweathermap.org" and then get sightseeing information by calling to "api.opentripmap.com".

The default city is set as Malta!
